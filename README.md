# fuel-route-optimization-api

🔹 Overview

A production-style Django REST API that calculates an optimized driving route between two locations in the USA and recommends cost-efficient fuel stops based on vehicle range and dynamic fuel pricing.

The system is designed for long-distance logistics planning where the objective is to minimize total fuel cost while respecting range constraints.

💡 Problem Statement

Long-distance travel often results in inefficient fuel planning, leading to unnecessary cost increases.

This system solves:

Optimal fuel stop selection
Range-constrained route segmentation
Fuel cost minimization across journey segments

🧠 System Design
Core Logic Flow:
Accept start and end coordinates
Compute total distance
Split route based on 500-mile constraint
Evaluate available fuel stations
Select lowest-cost valid stations
Return optimized stop sequence

📡 API Endpoint

### POST `/api/route/`

#### Request
```json
{
  "start": { "lat": 37.78, "lon": -122.42 },
  "end": { "lat": 25.76, "lon": -80.19 }
}

Response
{
  "total_distance_miles": 2591.23,
  "fuel_stops": [
    {
      "location": "Stop 1",
      "lat": 35.22,
      "lon": -90.11,
      "price": 3.45
    }
  ],
  "total_gallons_used": 259.12,
  "estimated_fuel_cost": 320.50,
  "message": "Optimized route generated successfully"
}


🗺️ Route Visualization 

The API returns coordinates that can be visualized using:

Google Maps API
Leaflet.js
Mapbox


🔍 Design Assumptions
Vehicle fuel efficiency is constant
Maximum range: 500 miles
Fuel stations loaded from static CSV
Distance approximated using geospatial formula


📊 Performance Consideration
Efficient greedy + constraint-based optimization
Lightweight CSV dataset for fast lookup
Modular service architecture for scalability


🧪 Testing Example
Use Postman or curl:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/route/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"start":{"lat":37.78,"lon":-122.42},"end":{"lat":25.76,"lon":-80.19}}'
